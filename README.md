# c-_Trig-Graphical-Calc
So someone on the internet said graphics.h sucked. So I tried making a calculator with graphics.h lib.
Ok. So, the way this works is by having a console program take the input, then translate that input into a graphics.h window.
I'm not exactly sure what I did here, but it a bit of fun for like 10 or 15 minutes.

Modify, copy, just credit me. Or give someone a hug.

Please enjoy!
